        Search Bar
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most Moloch tabs have a search bar on the top of the page.
        Moloch uses a very simple query language for building expressions. It
        supports grouping using parenthesis as well as logical AND and OR statements using &amp;&amp; and
        || respectively. Fields can be accessed directly using the field names
        and operators described in the <a href="#fields">table below</a>.
        Most fields also support a shorthand OR query using square brackets
        using CSV rules to list possible values (field==[item1,item2,item3]).
      </p>
      <p>
        All queries are bounded by a start and stop time. The bounded start and stop times can be
        set either by selecting a choice from a quick relative drop down or by entering exact time sections.
        Since every session has a first packet, last packet, and database timestamp, Moloch offers
        a choice on how to select the sessions:
      </p>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal small">
        <dt>First Packet</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">The timestamp of the first packet received for the session.</dd>
        <dt>Last Packet</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">The timestamp of the last packet received for the session.</dd>
        <dt>Bounded</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">Both the first and last packet timestamps for the session must be inside the time window.</dd>
        <dt>Session Overlaps</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">The timestamp of the first packet must be before the end of the time window AND the timestamp of the last packet must be after the start of the time window.</dd>
        <dt>Database</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">The timestamp the session was written to the database.  This can be up to several minutes AFTER the last packet was received.</dd>
      </dl>

      <br>

      <h4 id="stringSearch">String Search</h4>
      <p>
        In Moloch string fields are special since they can be searched in several different
        ways. When fields are indexed, their case may or may not be normalized,
        which is documented in the <a href="#fields">fields table below</a>.
        The types of string searches are:
      </p>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal small">
        <dt>Token</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">
          Some string fields are tokenized for faster searching. The query
          engine will automatically turn the search string(s) into tokens
          using the same algorithms as the indexing system.
        </dd>
        <dt>Wildcard</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">
          If a <code>*</code> appears in a expression, it is assumed a wildcard
          match is being used. Supported wildcards are <code>*</code>, which
          matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and
          <code>?</code>, which matches any single character. The wildcard query
          is run against the full text strings, after case normalization if
          enabled for the field. For example
          <code>http.uri == "www.f*k.com"</code> will capture an http.uri string
          which contains either www.fork.com or www.frack.com.
        </dd>
        <dt>Regex</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">
          A regex query must be surrounded by forward slashes and will always be
          anchored. This means you will almost always want to include a leading
          and trailing <code>.*.</code> within your regex query. The regex query
          is run against the full text strings, after case normalization (if enabled) for the field.
          For example <code>http.uri == /.*www\.f.*k\.com.*/.</code> It uses the
          Lucene regex implementation which doesn't support most PCRE features.
        </dd>
        <dt>Lists</dt>
        <dd class="margined-bottom">
          In Moloch, lists are used as a short hand method for doing multiple OR queries. For example
          <code>protocols == [http, ssh]</code>. This query will search for any sessions containing either http OR ssh.
          Note: Currently a list containing wildcard or regex strings will be processed as normal tokens instead
          of wildcards and regexes.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <br>

      <h4 id="ipSearch">IP Search</h4>
      <p>
        IP searching is very flexible and can be performed using the full ip
        address, a partial ip address, CIDR representation. For fields
        that include a port number, it is possible to follow any of the ip
        representations with a colon and then the port number to further refine a query. Ports are also
        first class searchable and may be searched for directly. For example:
        <code>ip == 1.2.3/24:80</code>. This query will search for all sessions which contain an IP address within the 1.2.3/24 CIDR range as well as utilizing port 80 during the session.
        An IP search can also be done with list of IPs which may be in mixed representations: <code>ip == [1.2.3.4, 1.3/16]</code>
      </p>

      <br>

      <h4 id="numericSearch">Numeric Search</h4>
      <p>
        Numeric fields support simple range operators besides the default equals
        and not equals query types. For example - show events with bytes transferred being less then 10000: <code>bytes &lt;= 10000</code>.
        Numeric fields also support lists for a simple OR query. For example: <code>port == [80,443,23]</code>
      </p>

      <br>

      <h4 id="dateSearch">Date Search</h4>
      <p>
        Date fields support simple range operators besides the default equals
        and not equals. For example: <code>starttime == "2004/07/31 05:33:41"</code>.
        They also support lists for a simple OR query. For example:
        <code>stoptime == ["2004/07/31 05:33:41", "2004/07/31 06:33:41"]</code>.
        Finally, relative dates and optional snapping are supported using the
        Splunk syntax:
      </p>

      <ul class="small">
        <li>
          Begin the string with a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate the offset from
          the current time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define the time amount with a number and a unit.
          The supported time units are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>second:</strong> s, sec, secs, second, seconds
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>minute:</strong> m, min, minute, minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>hour:</strong> h, hr, hrs, hour, hours
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>day:</strong> d, day, days
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>week:</strong> w, week, weeks
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>month:</strong> mon, month, months
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>quarter:</strong> q, qtr, qtrs, quarter, quarters
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>year:</strong> y, yr, yrs, year, years
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, specify a "snap to" time unit that indicates the nearest
          or latest time to which the time amount rounds down. Separate the time
          amount from the "snap to" time unit with an "@" character.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <h4 id="fieldExistsSearch">Field Exists Search</h4>
      <p>
        It is possible to check if a field has been set or not in the session by
        using the special comparison value of <code>field == EXISTS!</code> OR negated: <code>field != EXISTS!</code>.
        For example, to verify that a certificate doesn't have an issuer common name, but does
        have a issuer organizational name, the follow query could be used:
        <code>cert.issuer.cn != EXISTS! &amp;&amp; cert.issuer.on == EXISTS!</code>
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

      <p>
        Find all the sessions involving Russia (RUS) or China (CHN) that are
        using port 80 and also a hostname which contains "com":
        <pre>
          <code>(country == RUS || country == CHN) &amp;&amp; port == 80 &amp;&amp; host == *com</code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Find all the sessions of type "text/plain", involving Canada (CAN), and
        containing less than 20 packets:
        <pre>
          <code>tags == "http:content:text/plain" &amp;&amp; country == CAN &amp;&amp; packets &lt; 20</code>
        </pre>

        Sessions
      </h3>
      <p>
        The sessions tab within Moloch is where an analyst will find the bulk of details regarding
        the sessions which are being investigated. From top to bottom the sessions tab contains as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        The magnifying glass in the top left corner indicates the search bar. Enter your query string here and then hit ENTER or click the "Search" button to run your query.
        While typing fieldnames into the query bar predicative typing will overlay with potential fieldname choices based on what has been typed so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyeball icon will allow an Analyst to either overlay a save "View" onto their current query, or save the current query as a "View" for easy recall in the future.
        Views should be used for often used search queries that an Analyst regularly finds themselves running.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purple "Down" arrow contains a few options. The first is to export a PCAP of the required sessions data. Second, the data within the viewer may also be exported as a CSV for further review and manipulation.
        Third, Tags may be added to the sessions which have been detected by the Analyst's query. Theses events can then later be recalled by using the <code>tags == "blah"</code> statements.
        The fourth option is used to send the selected data to another system for further analysis. Each of these options may be applied to only sessions which have been opened (by clicking the sessions + box),
        any items visible (on the current page), or all items which have matched the query string.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next line on the sessions tab contains the time bounding selections. The first element sets relative timing (such as last hour, last day, etc).
        The Start box allows a start time/date to be selected. The End box allows an end time/date to be selected.
        The bounding box is used to select where time bounding is applied (last packet, bounded, Session Overlaps, Database)
      </p>
      <p>
        The next section contains a visualisation of the query's output. This quick glance visualization may be viewed by Session count, Packets count, or Databytes count.
        Clicking and dragging over bars within the chart will drill into the selected time frame so only it is selected. Additionally, a user can click the "+" or "-" magnifying glasses to quickly zoom out or zoom in the time window being observed.
      </p>
      <p>
      The pagination header and records per page selected box is immediately below the quick visualisation and are self descriptive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we arrive at the meat of the Sessions tab... Our Session Data! Before we drill into what can be observed within the sessions data, please take note of the purple box which contains 9 white squares. By clicking this box an Analyst may select
        any column that they wish to observed without opening a session fully. Predictive typing is also applied within this box. Example: An analyst is only investigating suspicious IRC sessions via the Analyst's search query. Instead of drilling into each
        session that Analyst has decided to only show the Start Time, End Time, Src IP, Src Port, Dst IP, Dst Pot, IRC Channel, and IRC Nickname. This column selection tool allows for an Analyst to readily view the information which is important to them,
        configurable per investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: describe right click interactions for column headers -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Viewing the sessions data of a specific network session is as easy as clicking the "Plus" sign next to a session. Upon clicking the + the session drawer will expand giving further context to the session.
        All packet data which was parsed will now be displayed. This includes everything fro the USer making the connection to the TCP Flags observed during the session.
        If the sessions is HTTP based further data such as Method, User Agents, and Response Headers are readily observable. The extracted Request and Response packet text will also be readily available in either a natural, ascii, utf8, or hex format.
        Furthermore, an analyst can uncompress response data as well as image files which were transferred during the session (be cautious with this option click if investigating sensitive images). Other files (such as mp3s, swf, or js files) may be clicked so that
        they may be downloaded and analyzed when necessary.

        SPI View
      </h3>
      <p>
        The SPI (Session Profile Information) View is used to dive into specific metrics of a session which and analyst wish to further focus in on. Instead of manually writing a query
        an analyst can use right click actions within the SPI View which will all the Analyst to add the specific item as an AND or AND NOT item to their query. This tab also allows an
        analyst a quick view into counts of each item that the user is interested in. As an example, if a analyst wanted to see all BASIC authorization headers that have been recorded
        over the current time Window and analyst could open the http drawer and click to enable the http.authorization field. The analyst could then update their search query to either
        include a specific authorization string which has been observed, or use a wild card to see all of a certain type of authorization header (Basic *, BEARER *, etc). Additionally,
        the SPI View allows an analyst a quick view of observed IP addresses within the time window, http response codes, IRC NICKs/Channels, and much, much more.

        SPI Graph
      </h3>
      <p>
        The SPI Graph tab allows a user to visualize, via bar charts over time, any item within the SPI View. This tab is very useful for both at a glance views of activity per SPI type,
        as well as deep dive analysis. As an example, if you wanted to chart all of the currently recorded http.users within your current time window, select http.user from the SPI Graph selection dropdown.
        Data will be displayed based upon count of observances over the time period. Increasing the Max Elements setting will allow an analyst to see additional items if the investigates SPI type is noisy.

        Connections
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Connections tab allows a user to view a tree force graph based on a source node and destination node of there choosing. Relationships may be visually determined using this method.
        An example of using this graph may be to set your Src node to ip.src, Dst node to ip.dst:port which will show the relationship of source IP addresses to destination IP address / port combinations.
        Those whom prefer to analyze session data view visualisation may heavily use these graphs. The default settings for this page may be set in the settings tab.

        Settings
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Settings tab allows for general user based settings to be managed. These settings include, timezone format, session detail format (such as ascii or hex), if timestamps should be displayed within session data,
        Which sessions column receives default sorting, the default graph for the SPI Graph tab, and the default Src field and Dst field for the Connections tab.
        Additionally, users may create views (saved queries) here as well. A user may also change their password on this page. If a user wishes to create a cron'd query
        they may add/remove these queries on this page as well.

        if the user is allowed access to the web interface, if the user is allowed access to http based Authorization Headers, if the user may search captured email data, if the user may remove data from the system (scrub).
